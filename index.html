                Ruth Bader Ginsburg was born in New York City on March 15, 1933. She was a good student in her youth, and graduated from high school at the age of 15.
                She later graduated from Cornell University with a bachelor of arts degree in government in 1954. Soon after, she married her husband Martin Ginsburg. 
                She enrolled at Harvard Law School and later transferred to Columbia Law School to earn her degree, becoming the first woman to be on two major law reviews: the Harvard Law
                Review and the Columbia Law Review.

                After her schooling, Ginsburg worked as a law clerk and later as a law professor at Rutgers University. In 1970 she co-founded the <i>Women's Rights Law Reporter</i>, the 
                first law jounral in the United States to focus exlusively on women's rights. She later co-founded the Women's Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union and became 
                the project's general counsel. During this time she worked on many cases to end gender discrimination in the law, representing both men and women in a strategic attempt to show 
                that gender discrimination was harmful to everyone. Her work greatly advanced women's rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

                Ginsburg was nominated and confirmed as a judge on the DC circuit appeals court in 1980. She served until 1993, when she was nominated by President Bill Clinton to join the 
                Supreme Court. Upon her swearing-in, she was the second female and first Jewish female justice of the Supreme Court. During her time on the court, she ruled favorably for gender equality, 
                abortion rights, voting rights, and affirmative action.

                Ginsburg served on the Supreme Court until her death from complications of pancreatic cancer in 2020. She was the first woman and the first Jew to lie in state at the Capitol, and was 
                later buried alongside her husband in Arlington National Cemetery. She will be remembered for her tireless work to advance gender equality, and she shines as an inspiration to all who seek equity and justice.
